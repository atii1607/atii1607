<h3 align="left"> Xatio: Nostalgic 2D Platform Game</h3>
<p>This is a graduation project I'm doing all by myself. It is a 2D nostalgic pixel platform game where you play as a brave little knight. Your goal is to navigate through levels filled with dangerous enemies, collect coins and magical berries, and reach the portals at the end of each stage. Language used for the project is C# and the game engine used is Unity. As for the backend, I've decided to create file slots in the AppData folder. Each file slot had it's unique folder and file. The files where the data was stored at were in JSON format.</p>

<h3 align="left"> Stock Management System </h3>
<p>This project was made with my good friend as our midterm project where we decided to create a management system. In this management system, the user can access the stocks and see which products are available or not. The user can search my name or by category such as Laptops, TV and more. Both admin and user panels were created. Java was used as the language and IntelliJ as the IDE. As for the backend, MySQL XAMPP and PhP was used.  </p>
